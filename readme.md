Positioining in CSS

    – Static --> /* It is actually the default, we don asign a position static. It renders the element in order of the document flow */
    – Relative --> /* The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so it falls naturaly. But we can add properties like top, left, right, bottom, & we can puush it to where we want  */
    – Absolute --> /* Will allow us  to target whatever position we want inside of a relative element */
    – Fixed --> /* It is a fixed position to the browser window, no matter so much we scroll, where we are iin the page, we are always in the same position */
    – Initial --> /* Initial sets the property to its default value */
